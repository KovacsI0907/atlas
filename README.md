# Atlas
This project (codenamed: Atlas) is a minecraft mod that aims to bring complexity to the exsisting crafting system by introducing a smithing mechanic. This will replace vanilla minecraft armor and weapons crafting with an xp based system. The mod also includes a market mechanic, where players can sell or buy items and blocks.
